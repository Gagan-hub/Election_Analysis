# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to do election data audit for a State  election commission. By using Python, we have to analyize the following: 
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received and calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
additional requests:-
5. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
6. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county our of the total count of votes.
7. Determine the county with the highest voter turnout. 

# Resources
1. Visual Studio
2. Git Bash
3. Python 3.7.6
4. Google
5. Class instructions and pratice codes

# The analysis of the election show that:
1. There were 369,711 total votes cast.
2. The candidates  and their voting share:
	- Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)

	- Denver: 306,055
	- Arapahoe: 24,801
5. The percentage of votes in each county from the total votes is as follows: 
	  - Jefferson: 10.5% 
	  - Denver: 82.8% 
	  - Arapahoe: 6.7% 
## Election Audit Summary
This script can be used for any future election audit given the csv file is formatted similarly as the one this script was created for. That is one way this code could be modified, to be able to control for the potential for information being formatted differently within the csv file.
